   &pgsphere; is not the part of the &postgresql; software. You can download
   the latest release from the
   <ulink url="&pgsphereurl;">&pgsphere; Releases page</ulink>.
   The source code can also be downloaded by cloning the repository with the
   appropriate release tag. The master branch is intended for development
   use and may contain the code in a transitional state. It is not recommended
   for use in production.

   It is assumed that &postgresql; is already installed. Depending on the
   system configuration, superuser (root) access rights may be required to
   complete the installation.
  </para>

  <para>
   The installation script uses &pg_config; utility. Make sure that the
   environment variable PATH includes path to &pg_config; utility. The path
   to &pg_config; can be also specified in make command:
    <programlisting>
<![CDATA[shell> make PG_CONFIG=/path/to/pgconfig ...]]>
    </programlisting>
  </para>

  <para>Unpack the downloaded archive and enter the directory:</para>
  <programlisting>
<![CDATA[shell> tar -xzf path/to/pgsphere-X.X.X.tgz]]>
<![CDATA[shell> cd pgsphere-X.X.X]]>
  </programlisting>

  <para>
   Compile the code. By default, &pgsphere; is compiled with the &healpix;
   support.
  </para>
  <programlisting>
<![CDATA[shell> make]]>
  </programlisting>
  <para>or compile without &healpix; support:</para>
  <programlisting>
<![CDATA[shell> make USE_HEALPIX=0]]>
  </programlisting>

  <para>
   Run regression tests optionally. If &pgsphere; was compiled without &healpix;
   support, USE_HEALPIX=0 should be specified in make command line.
  </para>
  <programlisting>
<![CDATA[shell> make test]]>
  </programlisting>

  <para>
   Install &pgsphere; files to the installation directories. The installation
   directories are defined by &pg_config; utility. Superuser (root) access
   rights may be required. If &pgsphere; was compiled without &healpix; support,
   USE_HEALPIX=0 should be added after make.

   We assume you have already created a database <database>userdb</database>,
   where <database>userdb</database> is the name of any database. Assume that

   It may be necessary to give more <command>psql</command> options, like port
   or host name, depending on your system configuration. Please, take a look at
   the psql user manual for details. The psql user manual for the latest
   &postgresql; version can be found at
